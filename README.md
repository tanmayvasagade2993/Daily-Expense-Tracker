View Expenses: View a list of all expenses entered, sorted by date.
Delete Expenses: Remove expenses from the list.
Filter by Category: Filter and view expenses by specific categories.
Total Expenses Calculation: View the total expenses for a given period.
Technologies Used
Java: Used for building the backend and frontend (Swing for GUI).
SQL: MySQL or SQLite used to store expense records in a database.
JDBC: Java Database Connectivity (JDBC) is used to interact with the SQL database.
Requirements
Java 8 or later
MySQL or SQLite database
JDBC driver for MySQL/SQLite
IDE such as IntelliJ IDEA or Eclipse

    amount DECIMAL(10, 2) NOT NULL
);
Configure Database Connection:
